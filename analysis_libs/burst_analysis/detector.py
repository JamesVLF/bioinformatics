        Computes a smoothed population firing rate and detects population bursts.
        Stores the following outputs as a list of tuples for each burst:
            times (np.ndarray): Time axis (in seconds), length = number of bins.
            smoothed (np.ndarray): Smoothed population rate over time.
            peaks (np.ndarray): Indices of peak burst times in the rate trace.
            bursts (List[Tuple[int, int]]): Start and end indices of each burst.

        Reverses the loop to match the edge and peak indices back to their absolute times in 'train'
        Outputs all stored tuples above, plus:
            peak_times (List[float]): Peak times in seconds for each detected burst.
            burst_windows (List[Tuple[float, float]]): Start and end times in seconds for each burst.

        Config Parameters for burst detection (from self.config):
            bin_size_ms (int): Time bin width in milliseconds for histogram (default 10 ms).
                - Affects temporal resolution of population rate.
            square_win_ms (int): Width of square window (in ms) for moving average smoothing.
                - Smooths fast fluctuations; combats noise.
            gauss_win_ms (int): Width of Gaussian smoothing window (in ms).
                - Smooths rate trace after square filter for refined shape.
            threshold_rms (float): Threshold multiplier (in RMS units) to define bursts.
                - Bursts are detected where population rate exceeds `threshold_rms * RMS(rate)`.
            min_dist_ms (int): Minimum distance (in ms) between detected burst peaks.
                - Prevents double-counting of close bursts.

        Method:
            (1) Concatenate all spike times into one array.
            (2) Bin spike counts across the whole population (bin_size_ms).
            (3) Smooth spike count using:
                - A square moving average (square_win_ms)
                - A Gaussian filter (gauss_win_ms)
            (4) Compute RMS of the smoothed signal.
            (5) Threshold = `threshold_rms * RMS` (threshold_rms).
            (6) Detect peaks using `scipy.signal.find_peaks`.
            (7) For each peak, walk backward / forward to clip at user-defined burst edges (edge_fraction).

        """
        Computes cosine similarity between each pair of bursts.
        For each burst, this method:
            1. Finds the peak index (in the smoothed population rate).
            2. Converts that to a center in bin-space.
            3. Extracts a fixed number of bins before and after that peak.

            win_bins = int(burst_window_s / bin_size_s) # e.g. 150 bins for 1.5s @ 10ms bins on each side of the peak_idx/time
            segment = ifr_matrix[:, peak_idx - win_bins : peak_idx + win_bins]

        The window size around each burst is therefore the same (~1.5 seconds here):
        |<------ 3.0 sec window ------>|
        |<-- 1.5 sec -->|<-- 1.5 -->|
             [ centered at burst peak ]

        It then creates an IFR slice centered at its peak with a shape of (n_units, 2 * win_bins).
        These uniform slices (the same duration, peak times, and number of bins) are then stacked into a 3D matrix
        with shape (n_bursts, n_units, 2 * win_bins).

        Limitations: This is an all-purpose method for a rough pass, but not good for analyzing
                        bursts with widely varying durations or shapes. It does not capture actual burst onset
                        or offset times, only a symmetrical window around the peak.

        Parameters:
            burst_matrices (list[np.ndarray] or np.ndarray):
                List of 2D arrays or a single 3D array [n_bursts, n_units, n_bins].

        Returns:
            np.ndarray: [n_bursts, n_bursts] matrix of cosine similarity.
